**Forest Conservation with AI**<br>
This is a 2-week course module on teaching AI for forest conversation, ideal for undergrad and graduate courses and is [available here](https://github.com/MissouriView/Forest-Conservation-with-AI). The course module was developed based the publication below.

Cota, G., Sagan, V., Maimaitijiang, M., and Freeman, K. (2021). Forest conservation with deep learning: A deeper understanding of human geography around the Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar. Remote Sens., 13(17), 3495; doi: [10.3390/rs13173495](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/17/3495).

This module contains scripts for three different parts 
1. For data preprocessing, training a CNN model, and application of the model to WV-3 imagery; 
2. Part 2 includes scripts for pixel-based machine/deep learning algorithms (SVM, RF, and DNN) available only to instructors who would like to use this material for their machine learning course;
3. A tutorial for forest change analysis using grid-cell approach.

The goal of this module is to create a tropical forest map (with other land cover/use type) using U-Net as the segmentation algorithm. The imagery used is WorldView-3 (WV-3), which contains 16 bands (8 bands in the visible region and 8 bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region).
