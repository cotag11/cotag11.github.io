<h2>Community Benefits Scorecard</h2>
<br>
This [Community Benefit Scorecard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/59fdb098b25146bca7063802e1bb3c2a/page/Residential/?draft=true) was created to inform the Economic Development Incentives team about how each potenial project scored against the pre-determined variables and depending on which category they fall under- Residential, Commercial or Mixed Use. The variables considered while creating the score are transit access, whether or not it is a vacant building, its location etc. There is a maximum number of points available for each of these variables. <br>
The data behind this scorecard was queried using SQL, and automated using Python and windows task scheduler.  <br>
