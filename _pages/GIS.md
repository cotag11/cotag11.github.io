<h2>Side Lot Sales Policy</h2>
<br>
This analysis was to determine which parcels were eligible for the side lot sales policy based on 3 conditions. (1) The property has to be available within the database, (2) its area has to be <4,000 sq feet and (3) not spatially contiguous to another property.

<h2>ARPA Transparency Portal</h2>
<br>
This [interactive dashboard](https://insights.arcgis.com/#/view/2f02aea33af84a8381c78d4de648f67c) was created through ArcGIS Insights. It serves as the transparency portal for appropriations, programmed funds and expenditures as it relates to the American Rescue Plan Act projects. <br>

<h2>Community Benefits Scorecard</h2>
<br>
This [Community Benefit Scorecard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/59fdb098b25146bca7063802e1bb3c2a/page/Residential/?draft=true) was created to inform the Economic Development Incentives team about how each potenial project scored against the pre-determined variables and depending on which category they fall under- Residential, Commercial or Mixed Use. The variables considered while creating the score are transit access, whether or not it is a vacant building, its location etc. There is a maximum number of points available for each of these variables. <br>
The data behind this scorecard was queried using SQL, and automated using Python and windows task scheduler.  <br>

**In addition to these public facing ones, I also created internal facing dashboards and applications and conducted appropriate geospatial analyses**
