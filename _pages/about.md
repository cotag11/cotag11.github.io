Hello! Welcome to my website dedicated to showcase a few geospatial and remote sensing projects I've completed in my professional career. <br>
I'm a GIS professional, but I have experiece with working with imagery datasets as well. In my past roles, I've managed an entire organizations enterprise geodatabase and the associated analytics. I proactively created dynamic web applications for both internal and external use. I'm proficient with python and some familiarity with SQL for data management and analytics. I'm adept with working with imagery acquired from UAVs and have experience with drone data collection and ground-based data collection methods. I've created training materials on GIS and remote sensing and mentored students on how they could incorporate geospatial data and methods in their respective research areas. I published my graduate thesis work that applied machine learning methods to raster imagery and conducted geospatial analytics on the resulting land use land cover map. I graduated from Saint Louis University with a masterâ€™s in Geographic Information Science, and received an undergraduate degree in Geology with honours in Physics. Currently focused on imagery-based analytics and research. 
<br>
I have around 3 years of experience of using both geospatial analysis and remote sensing methods for a variety of applications including conservation, economic development and agriculture. 
<br>
If you have any questions about any of the projects listed on the [GIS](https://cotag11.github.io/GIS/) or [Remote Sensing](https://cotag11.github.io/RemoteSensing/) pages, please send me an email. I'll be delighted to hear from you and explore how we can work together.
